            <li>1 cup water</li>

            <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Frosting</h4>
        
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 (3.5 ounce) package instant banana cream pudding mix</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) container low-fat frozen whipped topping (such as Cool Whip® Lite), thawed</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
